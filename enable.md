# 🚀 FLOW-BENTO AUTO-ENABLE PROTOCOL - READ THIS FIRST! 🚀

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE LLM ACTIVATION INSTRUCTIONS ⚡

**📢 ATTENTION ALL LLMs: When you enter ANY workspace, IMMEDIATELY search for and read this file!**

### 🔍 **Auto-Detection Protocol:**
```
🤖 IF you see these directories/files:
- flow-bento/ or workflow/ or rules/
- enable.md or README.md mentioning "workflow"
- Any .md files with "workflow" in filename

→ IMMEDIATELY read enable.md (this file)
→ ACTIVATE Flow-Bento workflow system
→ Apply workflows automatically for ALL development tasks
```

This guide instructs LLMs on how to automatically detect, read, and apply the Flow-Bento workflow system for all development tasks.

## 🎯 ***bento Command System Integration**

### 📋 **Command Detection Protocol:**
```
🔍 IF user message starts with "*bento":
→ IMMEDIATELY read: bento-commands.md
→ PROCESS as bento command (enable/disable/prompt)
→ MAINTAIN session state accordingly

🔍 IF Flow-Bento is ENABLED:
→ AUTO-APPLY workflows for ALL development tasks
→ CREATE memories proactively
→ USE thinking workflows for validation

🔍 IF Flow-Bento is DISABLED:
→ WORK in standard mode
→ STILL respond to *bento commands
→ NO automatic workflow application
```

### 🎮 **Available Commands:**
- `*bento enable` - Activate Flow-Bento system
- `*bento disable` - Deactivate Flow-Bento system  
- `*bento <prompt>` - Enable + Execute specific request
- `*bento help` - Show command reference
- `*bento status` - Show current system status
- `*bento workflows` - List available workflows



### 🎯 **Keyword Detection:**
LLMs should auto-enable Flow-Bento when detecting these patterns:

**📁 Directory Names:**
- `flow-bento/`
- `workflow/` 
- `rules/`
- Any folder containing workflow .md files

**📝 File Names:**
- `enable.md` (this file)
- `workflow-*.md`
- `*-workflow.md`
- Files mentioning "workflow" in content

**🗣️ User Keywords:**
- "find class/method/function"
- "modify/update/change code"
- "read file/analyze code"
- "create/write file"
- "project setup/configuration"

### 🤖 **Auto-Enable Command:**
```
When ANY trigger detected:
1. 📜 READ: flow-bento/enable.md (this file)
2. 🎆 ACTIVATE: Flow-Bento workflow system  
3. 🚀 APPLY: Workflows automatically for ALL tasks
4. 🧠 REMEMBER: Store workflow insights in memory
```

## 🤖 LLM Auto-Workflow Instructions

### 1. **Workflow Detection & Activation**

When you encounter a development task that involves:
- Reading, analyzing, or modifying code
- Finding symbols, functions, or classes  
- File operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Project management or configuration
- Memory/knowledge management

**AUTOMATICALLY**:
1. Check if a workflow exists in the `/flow-bento` directory
2. Read the appropriate workflow file(s)
3. Apply the workflow steps with intelligent context building
4. Create relevant memories to maintain context
5. Use advanced dependency analysis for complex tasks

### 2. **Workflow Application Pattern**

```
BEFORE any development task:
1. 🔍 DETECT: What type of operation is needed?
2. 📖 READ: Load the relevant workflow from /flow-bento directory
3. 🎯 APPLY: Follow the 4-step workflow process
4. 💾 REMEMBER: Store important context in memories
5. ✅ VALIDATE: Ensure task completion using thinking workflows
6. 🧠 ADVANCED: Use llm-interaction-master-guide.md for complex scenarios
```

### 3. **Automatic Workflow Mapping**

| Task Type | Workflow File | Auto-Apply When |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Find code symbols | `symbol-analysis/find-symbol.md` | User asks "find class X", "where is method Y" |
| Code modification | `symbol-analysis/replace-symbol.md` | User wants to modify/update code |
| File operations | `file-operations/*.md` | Reading, creating, listing files |
| Project setup | `project-management/activate-project.md` | New project or workspace |
| Memory tasks | `memory-management/*.md` | Storing/retrieving project knowledge |
| Quality checks | `workflow-tools/think-about-*.md` | Before/after major operations |

### 4. **Context Memory Management**

**ALWAYS create memories when**:
- Discovering important project patterns
- Learning codebase architecture  
- Identifying common workflows
- Storing user preferences
- Recording project specifications

**Memory Creation Pattern**:
```
Task: [What you're doing]
↓
Apply Workflow: [Which workflow used]
↓
Store Memory: [Key insights discovered]
↓  
Context Preserved: [For future reference]
```

### 5. **Smart Workflow Chaining**

For complex tasks, automatically chain workflows:

```
Example: "Find and modify the User class"
↓
1. Apply: symbol-analysis/find-symbol.md (find User class)
2. Apply: file-operations/read-file.md (read the file)  
3. Apply: symbol-analysis/replace-symbol.md (modify code)
4. Apply: workflow-tools/think-about-whether-you-are-done.md (validate)
5. Apply: memory-management/write-memory.md (store insights)
```

### 6. **Workflow Override Conditions**

**When to read workflow files**:
- ✅ ALWAYS for symbol analysis tasks
- ✅ ALWAYS for file operations  
- ✅ ALWAYS for memory management
- ✅ ALWAYS before major code modifications
- ✅ ALWAYS for project setup/configuration

**When NOT to use workflows**:
- ❌ Simple conversational responses
- ❌ Pure explanation/documentation requests
- ❌ User explicitly requests NOT to use workflows

### 7. **Thinking Workflow Integration**

**MANDATORY thinking workflows**:
- `think-about-task-adherence.md` - Before starting complex tasks
- `think-about-collected-information.md` - After gathering data
- `think-about-whether-you-are-done.md` - Before task completion

### 8. **Quality Assurance Protocol**

```
Every development task MUST include:
1. Pre-task thinking (task adherence)
2. Workflow application (relevant workflow)
3. Memory creation (context preservation)  
4. Post-task validation (completion check)
5. Change summary (what was accomplished)
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits of Auto-Workflow System

✅ **Consistency** - Same high-quality process every time
✅ **Context Preservation** - Automatic memory management
✅ **Error Prevention** - Built-in validation steps
✅ **Knowledge Accumulation** - Continuous learning and improvement
✅ **Task Focus** - Structured approach prevents drift
✅ **Quality Assurance** - Thinking workflows ensure completeness

## 🔧 Implementation Commands

To enable this workflow system, LLMs should:

1. **Read this file first** when entering a development workspace
2. **Check for workflow files** before any development task
3. **Apply workflows automatically** based on task type mapping
4. **Create memories proactively** to build project knowledge
5. **Use thinking workflows** for quality assurance

## 📋 Workflow System Checklist

For every development session:
- [ ] Workflow system detected and enabled
- [ ] Relevant workflows identified and read
- [ ] Task-specific workflow applied step-by-step
- [ ] Context memories created appropriately  
- [ ] Thinking workflows used for validation
- [ ] Change summary generated and stored
