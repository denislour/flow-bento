# Think About Collected Information

## Function Description (Replaces ThinkAboutCollectedInformationTool)

After completing a non-trivial sequence of information gathering steps (find_symbol, find_referencing_symbols, search_files_for_pattern, read_file, etc.), execute the following workflow to evaluate the completeness and relevance of collected information:

## Step 1: Review Information Gathering Process
**Description**: Analyze the sequence of information collection activities performed
**Review Criteria**:
- What information was collected and from which sources
- Which tools were used and in what sequence
- How much information was gathered overall
- Whether the gathering was focused or scattered

**Information Sources Assessment**:
```
# Symbol analysis activities
‚Üí find_symbol results - What symbols were discovered
‚Üí find_referencing_symbols results - What references were found
‚Üí symbols_overview results - What file structures were examined

# File operations activities
‚Üí read_file operations - Which files were examined
‚Üí search_patterns results - What code patterns were found
‚Üí file_listings - What directory structures were explored

# Memory operations
‚Üí memory_reads - What project knowledge was accessed
‚Üí memory_writes - What new knowledge was documented
```

## Step 2: Assess Information Completeness
**Description**: Evaluate whether gathered information is sufficient for the current task
**Completeness Evaluation**:
- Is the information sufficient to understand the problem?
- Are there obvious gaps in understanding?
- Have all relevant aspects been explored?
- Is additional information needed before proceeding?

**Completeness Indicators**:
```
# Sufficient information signs
‚úÖ Clear understanding of problem scope
‚úÖ Identified relevant code components
‚úÖ Understanding of data flows and dependencies
‚úÖ Knowledge of existing implementations
‚úÖ Awareness of potential impact areas

# Insufficient information signs
‚ùå Unclear problem boundaries
‚ùå Missing critical code components
‚ùå Unknown dependencies or relationships
‚ùå Gaps in understanding implementation details
‚ùå Uncertain about modification impact
```

## Step 3: Evaluate Information Relevance
**Description**: Determine how well the collected information relates to the current task
**Relevance Assessment**:
- Does the information directly address the current task?
- Is there irrelevant information that should be filtered out?
- Are there patterns or insights that emerged from the data?
- How does the information guide next steps?

**Relevance Categories**:
```
# Highly relevant information
‚Üí Directly related to current task requirements
‚Üí Shows implementation patterns needed
‚Üí Reveals constraints or dependencies
‚Üí Provides clear guidance for next steps

# Moderately relevant information
‚Üí Provides context but not directly actionable
‚Üí Shows related but not essential components
‚Üí Gives background understanding
‚Üí May be useful for future tasks

# Irrelevant information
‚Üí Not related to current task goals
‚Üí Outdated or obsolete information
‚Üí Incorrect or misleading data
‚Üí Distracting from main objectives
```

## Step 4: Determine Next Actions
**Description**: Based on the analysis, decide what actions to take next
**Action Categories**:
- **Proceed**: Information is sufficient, move to implementation
- **Gather More**: Need additional specific information
- **Refocus**: Information is off-track, need to refocus search
- **Analyze Deeper**: Information exists but needs deeper analysis

**Decision Framework**:
```
# Ready to proceed
‚Üí Problem is well understood
‚Üí Implementation approach is clear
‚Üí Dependencies and impacts are known
‚Üí Risk factors have been identified

# Need more information
‚Üí Critical gaps in understanding
‚Üí Missing implementation details
‚Üí Unknown dependencies or side effects
‚Üí Unclear requirements or constraints

# Need to refocus
‚Üí Information is too scattered
‚Üí Focus has drifted from original task
‚Üí Too much irrelevant information collected
‚Üí Need to return to core requirements

# Need deeper analysis
‚Üí Information is available but not well synthesized
‚Üí Patterns or insights are not clear
‚Üí Relationships between components unclear
‚Üí Need to organize and structure findings
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Information Assessment
```
‚úÖ Review information quality periodically during gathering
‚úÖ Check relevance to original task frequently
‚úÖ Assess completeness before moving to implementation
‚úÖ Organize findings as you collect them

‚ùå Collect information without assessment
‚ùå Let information gathering become unfocused
‚ùå Proceed with incomplete understanding
‚ùå Ignore information quality indicators
```

### 2. Focus on Task Requirements
```
‚úÖ Keep original task goals in mind during information gathering
‚úÖ Evaluate information relevance to task requirements
‚úÖ Filter out interesting but irrelevant information
‚úÖ Stay focused on actionable insights

‚ùå Follow interesting tangents without purpose
‚ùå Collect information without clear goals
‚ùå Lose sight of original task requirements
‚ùå Get lost in implementation details too early
```

### 3. Balance Breadth and Depth
```
‚úÖ Start with broad understanding, then focus
‚úÖ Gather enough context before diving deep
‚úÖ Know when you have sufficient information
‚úÖ Avoid both under-research and over-research

‚ùå Go too deep too early without context
‚ùå Stay too high-level without specifics
‚ùå Continue gathering information indefinitely
‚ùå Make decisions with insufficient information
```
