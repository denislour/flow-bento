```

### 4. Plan for Seamless Continuation
```
✅ Provide clear startup sequence for next conversation
✅ Identify essential context that must be maintained
✅ Suggest logical next steps and priorities
✅ Ensure nothing critical is lost in transition

```

### Transition Planning
```
→ Create clear roadmap for next conversation
→ Identify priority areas for immediate attention
