```
# Need initial instructions when:
✅ Asked to perform coding tasks without prior project context
✅ Working in environments like Claude Desktop without system prompts
✅ Missing guidance on development workflow and tool usage
✅ Unclear about project standards and conventions

# May not need initial instructions when:
❌ Already received comprehensive system prompt
❌ Working on simple, non-coding tasks
❌ Clear project context already provided
