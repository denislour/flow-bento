# Replace Symbol Workflow - Quick Reference

## 🚀 Quick Start Pattern

```
User Request: "Update/modify/change [symbol]"
↓
1. 🔍 FIND: Apply find-symbol.md workflow first
2. 📖 READ: Apply read-file.md to get current code  
3. ✏️ REPLACE: Apply replace-symbol.md workflow
4. 💾 REMEMBER: Store modification insights
5. ✅ VALIDATE: Use think-about-whether-you-are-done.md
```

## 🎯 Common Replace Symbol Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Method Implementation Update
```
Request: "Update the login method"
↓
Workflow Chain:
1. find-symbol.md → Locate login method
2. read-file.md → Read current implementation
3. replace-symbol.md → Replace method body safely
4. write-memory.md → Store change pattern
```

### Scenario 2: Class Modification
```
Request: "Modify User class to add new field"
↓  
Workflow Chain:
1. find-symbol.md → Find User class
2. symbols-overview.md → Understand class structure
3. replace-symbol.md → Add new field safely
4. write-memory.md → Store architectural change
```

### Scenario 3: Function Refactoring
```
Request: "Refactor processData function"
↓
Workflow Chain:
1. find-symbol.md → Locate processData function
2. find-references.md → Find all usage locations
3. read-file.md → Understand current implementation
4. replace-symbol.md → Replace with refactored version
5. write-memory.md → Store refactoring pattern
```

## 🔧 Replace Symbol Safety Checklist

### Pre-Replacement Validation
- [ ] Target symbol found and identified uniquely
- [ ] Current implementation understood completely
- [ ] All references and dependencies mapped
- [ ] Backup/rollback plan established

### During Replacement
- [ ] Follow 4-step replace-symbol workflow exactly
- [ ] Maintain code style and formatting consistency
- [ ] Preserve existing functionality unless explicitly changing
- [ ] Handle edge cases and error conditions

### Post-Replacement Validation  
- [ ] New code compiles/runs without errors
- [ ] Functionality works as intended
- [ ] No breaking changes to dependent code
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Change insights stored in memory

## 🧠 Integration with Thinking Workflows

### Before Replace Symbol
```
Apply: think-about-task-adherence.md
Questions:
- Do I understand the full scope of changes needed?
- Are there dependencies I need to consider?
- What are the risks of this modification?
```

### After Replace Symbol
```
Apply: think-about-whether-you-are-done.md
Questions:
- Does the new code meet all requirements?
- Are there any edge cases not handled?
- Should I test the changes?
- What documentation needs updating?
```

## ⚡ Speed Optimization Tips

### For Frequent Modifications
1. **Build Symbol Maps**: Store commonly modified symbols in memory
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Learn user's modification patterns
3. **Bulk Operations**: Chain multiple replace operations efficiently
4. **Template Reuse**: Store and reuse successful modification templates

### For Complex Refactoring
1. **Incremental Approach**: Break large changes into smaller steps
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Build comprehensive dependency understanding
3. **Validation Checkpoints**: Validate at each step before proceeding
4. **Rollback Planning**: Maintain clear rollback procedures

## 🎨 Customization Guidelines

### Project-Specific Adaptations
- Learn and apply project coding standards
- Understand project architecture patterns
- Adapt to team's modification practices
- Integrate with project's testing requirements

### User-Specific Adaptations  
- Learn user's preferred coding style
- Understand user's risk tolerance
- Adapt to user's validation preferences
- Remember user's common modification patterns
